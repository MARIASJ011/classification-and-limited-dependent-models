# Classification & Limited Dependent Variable Models
Overview

This assignment applies classification and limited dependent variable models using both R and Python across two real-world datasets:

Heart Disease Dataset – to predict the presence of heart disease

NSSO 68th Round Household Survey – to model non-vegetarian consumption behavior

The assignment demonstrates end-to-end modeling workflows including logistic regression, probit models, decision trees, Tobit regression, model diagnostics, and performance evaluation.

Objectives

Build and evaluate binary classification models

Compare parametric (Logit, Probit) and non-parametric (Decision Tree) approaches

Handle censored dependent variables using Tobit regression

Assess model quality using:

Confusion matrices

ROC curves & AUC

Multicollinearity diagnostics

Goodness-of-fit tests

Datasets
1️) Heart Disease Dataset

Target variable: target (presence of heart disease)

Predictors: clinical and physiological indicators

Used for:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classification

2️) NSSO 68 Household Consumption Survey

Binary outcome: non_veg (whether a household consumes non-vegetarian food)

Censored outcome: nonveg_total_qty (total non-veg consumption quantity)

Predictors include:

Demographics (Age, Sex, Education)

Socio-economic indicators

Household characteristics

Regional variables

Methodology
Part A: Logistic Regression (Heart Dataset)

Converted target variable to factor / binary

Fitted Logistic Regression

Checked:

Multicollinearity using VIF

Model fit using Hosmer–Lemeshow test

Evaluated performance using:

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve and AUC

Part B: Probit Model (NSSO Data)

Created a binary indicator for non-vegetarian consumption

Estimated a Probit regression model

Analyzed how demographic and socio-economic factors influence dietary choice

Part C: Decision Tree Classification

Trained a Decision Tree classifier

Visualized tree structure

Compared predictive performance with logistic regression

Evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve and AUC

Part D: Tobit Regression (Censored Data)

Constructed a censored dependent variable for non-veg consumption quantity

Applied Tobit regression to handle zero-consumption censoring

Estimated determinants of non-veg consumption intensity

Tools & Technologies
R

tidyverse – data manipulation

caret – model evaluation

pROC – ROC & AUC

ResourceSelection – Hosmer–Lemeshow test

car – VIF diagnostics

rpart, rpart.plot – decision trees

AER – Tobit regression

Python

pandas, numpy – data handling

scikit-learn – classification models

statsmodels – Probit & Tobit modeling

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization

Key Insights

Logistic and Probit models provide interpretable probability estimates

Decision Trees capture non-linear patterns but risk overfitting

Tobit regression is essential when outcomes are censored at zero

Model performance varies by method and dataset, highlighting trade-offs between interpretability and flexibility

Notes

File paths should be updated based on local system setup

Some categorical variables require proper encoding before modeling

This assignment is part of academic coursework and focuses on applied econometric and machine learning techniques
